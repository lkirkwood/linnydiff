* My first heading
This is some content that I am writing.
Here is a line that will be deleted.
This one won't.

* A second heading
** This one has a subheading
This is another deleted line.
*** This subheading will be deleted too
Along with all its content

*** But this subheading will survive
Live to see another day.

* Here is some code
This code will change.

#+begin_src python
def foobar():
    return "bazbar"
#+end_src
