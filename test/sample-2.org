* My first heading
This is some content that I am writing.
This one won't.
This one was added!

* A second heading
** This one has a subheading
*** But this subheading will survive
Live to see another day.

* Here is some code
This code will change.

#+begin_src python
def bazbar():
    return "foobar"
#+end_src

* This is a new heading
This wasn't in the other file.
